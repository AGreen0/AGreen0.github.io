## Assignment 1: Building a Simple Agent Based Model (ABM)

#### This source code, written in Python, generates a simple agent based model. 
The code consists of an agentframework and model that implements it. The model uses a Graphical User Interface (GUI) which utilises a run menu bar.  

A window will appear when the code is run titled 'Model'; to run the model select the run option in the top left corner. 
The agents within the model move randomly throughout the environment whilst eating, storing and sharing with their neighbouring agents until a stopping condition is reached. 
Data has been scraped from a web page to initiate the starting locations of the agents.
