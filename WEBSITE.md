## Assignment 1: Building a Simple Agent Based Model (ABM)

#### This source code, written in Python, generates a simple agent based model. 
The code consists of an agentframework and model that implements it. The model uses a Graphical User Interface (GUI) which utilises a run menu bar.  

A window will appear when the code is run titled 'Model'; to run the model select the run option in the top left corner. 
The agents within the model move randomly throughout the environment whilst eating, storing and sharing with their neighbouring agents until a stopping condition is reached. 
Data has been scraped from a web page to initiate the starting locations of the agents. 

One issue that appears unresolved is that when the GUI Model window appears, another Figure window pops up. The Figure window cannot be deleted and is not applicable to the actual model. With further time, there would be hope that this window could be removed (however, it doesn't harm the running of the actual model). 

To enhance the model further, a second group of agents could be incorporated that 'hunted' the initial agents, to deplete their original stores.
